    <h4>About Food Watch:</h4>
    <p>Food Watch is an application providing consumers with useful, real-time information about food recalls in the United States. Each year, hundreds of human and animal foods are recalled from the market by their manufacturers. Most recalls are voluntary; in some cases they may be ordered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Food Watch helps inform consumers of the potential health hazards of recently recalled foods. All of Food Watch’s data is based on public information made available through OpenFDA. Food Watch gives consumers access to all food recalls dating as far back as 2004. (Important note: the data prior to mid-2012 is incomplete and has not been validated with internal FDA data. This dataset, like all datasets at OpenFDA, is a work in progress.)</p>
