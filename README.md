# FOOD WATCH (POOL 3)

http://food-watch-pool3.iptassociates.com/

IPT Associates, LLC (IPT) used our Agile Vi™ methodology to quickly deliver Food Watch, our OpenFDA Minimum Viable Product (MVP) solution. IPT’s Agile Vi methodology blends the business and technical sides of IPT to form a wholly collaborative Agile enterprise, where iterative processes and continuous feedback loops enable us to quickly deliver customer-focused solutions. Agile Vi allows us to respond rapidly to shifting requirements, make decisions based on the tangible results we deliver, and remove the unnecessary unpredictability associated with traditional software development processes.  

The Food Watch prototype was designed and developed using the following Agile Vi process which aligns with the U.S. Digital Services Playbook.

## Overall Design & Development Methodology

Food Watch is an example of IPT’s design and development process compressed into mini-sprints aligned to the original proposal deadline. In a typical design process, these sprints are usually two to three weeks, but for the purpose of this prototype we performed three two-day sprints to show the entirety of our process. All evidence criteria can be found in IPT’s GitHub repository.

During Sprint 1, the customer “Need Statement” that drives the overall development process is garnered. Sprint 2 develops the prototype, and Sprint 3 iterates on the design. After (and sometimes during) each sprint, user reviews and usability tests occur. The results of these tests and reviews inform the subsequent sprints. 

Prior to Sprint 1, we assembled a diverse, lean Agile scrum team and clarified each member’s primary role and responsibilities; discuss diverse viewpoints of the team; and decide on the objectives, outcomes solution strategies, and identify known constraints. We identified Mike as the experienced Product Manager (PM) with the authority and responsibility for making decisions and removing obstacles. 

## Sprint 1: Envisioning   

Sprint 1 focused on meeting with the customer, brainstorming, designing layouts and mock-ups with the customer, preparing our Requirements and Design Document (RDD), and reviewing the design with the customer for acceptance.   

### Sprint 1 Goal: *Capture the customer’s vision.* Activities included:

* Met with customer to discuss vision and desired outcomes for OpenFDA initiative 
* Defined user personas and developed a customer “Need Statement” as the underpinning for prototype development: Provide consumers with useful information based on the data made available through OpenFDA
* Decided on Food Watch as the solution name, briefly described tool
* Used 5 user-centered techniques or tools: (1) User Interview & Interactive Brainstorm Session, (2) Developed Use Cases, (3) Designed Wireframe, (4) Developed the Food Watch RDD provided in GitHub repository and got user feedback, (5) User survey and crowdsourcing of Food Watch logo design

## Sprint 2: Prototype Development

Sprint 2 takes the knowledge gained from interaction with the customer and develops the requirements into functional software. Based on the RDD, one or more sprints are scheduled within a release window. A typical release usually contains two to four development sprints, with each sprint having at least one customer review session at the end, but IPT’s Agile Vi development process involves the customer as often as possible and as it is appropriate. 

### Sprint 2 Goal: *Develop the use cases and requirements into functional software*. Activities included: 

* Team identified a MVP based on the use cases: the Food Watch food recall exploration tool  
* Used the test scenarios to complete outcome driven testing
* Created a product style guide to establish a consistent Food Watch style
* Instantiated the solution technical architecture and deployed solution on Microsoft Azure Web App PaaS
* We chose a modern technology stack using 10 open source technologies (e.g. Durandal, Bootstrap, jQuery, .NET)
* Set up and used continuous integration to execute unit tests and deployed to isolated MS Azure Wep App container
* Set up and used configuration management in Visual Studio Online with GIT repository and continuous monitoring capabilities in Azure Web App
* Performed usability tests with users and incorporated feedback into iterative development 

## Sprint 3: Delivery Preparation 

The final sprint before a release ensures that we have a quality feature set for the customer, and that any critical feedback the customer desires is incorporated into the release product. (If customer input is not feasible to implement, some feedback tasks move to the next release iteration.) This sprint is also where release notes/install guides/packages for release are finalized if required. 

### Sprint 3 Goal: *Deliver a working prototype that satisfies the customer vision*. Activities include:  

* Ensured prototype worked on multiple devices (IE, Google Chrome, iOS, Android) mobile and presented a responsive design 
* Performed usability tests with users and incorporated feedback into iterative development 
* Created installation guide 
* Held final internal review to ensure release goals were met 
* Released Food Watch into production as part of the continuous release cycle 
* Held release post-mortem to ensure lessons learned are captured and used to inform the next release
